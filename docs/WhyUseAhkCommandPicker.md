# Why Use AHK Command Picker

AutoHotkey is such a powerful language and can be used to do so many things.
Because of this you will likely have many AHK scripts/hotkeys to accomplish a variety of different tasks, some that you use frequently and others not so frequently.

AHK Command Picker solves the following problems:

- Trying to remember which hotkeys (i.e. key combinations) are used to launch which scripts (e.g. "Which script does Win+A launch again?").
- Trying to find new hotkeys that aren't already used by other applications (e.g. "I hit Ctrl+N to open a new tab in my application, but it launched one of my scripts as well. Oops").
- Accidentally launching scripts by unintentionally hitting a hotkey key combination (e.g. "My fingers weren't on home-row as I thought they were", or "My cat walked across the keyboard").

AHK Command Picker also allows you to:

- Browse your list of commands (i.e. functions / scripts), each with an optional user-friendly description.
- Easily provide parameters to your commands, which can be used to alter a command's functionality.
  - You can also provide preset parameter values that get shown in the command picker.
- Still execute your AHK code very quickly by [CamelCase][CamelCaseExplanationUrl] filtering the commands and preset parameters as you type.
- Automate more tasks.
